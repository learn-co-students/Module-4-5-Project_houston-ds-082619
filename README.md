# Module 4/5 Project - Houston Data Science - 082619

We've toiled through projects together, venturing down strange paths towards new models with all their quirks, dodging smoothing techniques, poisoned data and all the joys of time series - but now, it's time to choose your own adventure.

## The Project

For this project, you're going to select a dataset **of your choosing** and create a model to solve a problem **that you define**. 

The goal is to use everything you've learned about Data Science and Machine Learning thus far to source a dataset, pre-process and explore it, and then build and interpret a model that answers your chosen question. You should showcase your knowledge of the whole data science process, from start to finish, preferably using a defined data science lifecycle process like OSEMN or CRISP-DM.

### Selecting a Data Set/Defining Your Problem

We encourage you to either:

- Pick a problem/data set that is _very similar_ to what you're thinking about for your final project, and use this week to explore the feasibility of your ideas (before committing to doing that kind of project for your capstone).

- Pick a problem/data set that is _very different_ from what you're thinking about doing for your final project, to showcase a different set of skills in a portfolio.

Both options are equally valid - and, if you don't yet have any ideas regarding your capstone, don't worry too much on that and simply pick a data set which interests you which you think you can explore and work with in a week.

### Problem First, or Data First?

In addition to the above, there are two ways that you can think about getting started: _Problem-First_ or _Data-First_. 

- **Problem-First**: Start with a problem that you want to solve, and then try to find the data you need to solve it.  If you can't find any data to solve your problem, then you should pick another problem. 

- **Data-First**: Take a look around at cool data sets available online. If you find a data set that's particularly interesting for you, then it's totally okay to build your problem around that data set. 

We highly recommend you use a [Kaggle competition](https://kaggle.com/competitions) or a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), because of the community and because there are often pre-defined questions for you to answer (plus, contributing to Kaggle is a great way to network/showcase your skills!). 

In addition, some other places to look for data include:

* [UCI Machine Learning Datasets Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html)
* [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
* [Awesome Datasets Repo on Github](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets)
* [New York City Open Data Portal](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/)
* [Inside AirBNB ](http://insideairbnb.com/)


## The Deliverables

Your completed project should contain the following deliverables:

1. At least one **_Jupyter Notebook_** containing any code you've written for this project, along with a technical explanation.  

2. A **_Readme_** explaining your problem/dataset, along with your process, methodology, and findings, but yet understandable to a lay-audience. If you're using multiple Jupyter notebooks, your Readme should outline which notebook contains what.

3. An **_"Executive Summary" PowerPoint Presentation_** that gives a brief overview of your problem/dataset, and each step of the Data Science process - this should be written for a non-technical audience! 

4. A **_github repository_** that will host all of this material. There should be at least 5 commits! Don't just wait until the end to commit in one fell swoop, you should ideally be committing several times per day.

### Jupyter Notebook Must-Haves

For this project, your Jupyter notebook(s) should meet the following specifications:

* The notebook(s) contain a clear record of your process and methodology for exploring and preprocessing your data, building and tuning a model, and interpreting your results. 

* The notebook(s) is well organized, easy to follow, and code is commented where appropriate.  

    * _Level Up_: The notebook(s) contains well-formatted, professional looking markdown cells explaining any substantial code. All functions have docstrings that act as professional-quality documentation.  

* The notebook(s) is written to technical audiences with a way to both understand your approach and reproduce your results. The target audience for this deliverable is other data scientists looking to validate your findings.  

### Readme Must-Haves

Your Readme should clearly explain your process and results, including:

* An explanation of the problem you're trying to solve, your approach to solving that problem, and your findings/results.
* An explanation of how to reproduce your results, including where to find your dataset (especially relevant if you don't host the data on your github).

Take the time to make sure that you craft your story well, and clearly explain your process and findings in a way that clearly shows both your technical expertise **_and_** your ability to communicate your results! Even if this project isn't portfolio-ready after one week, use this opportunity to prepare yourself for your capstone and get used to laying out projects in a clear and professional manner. 

### Presentation Must-Haves

Y'all know the drill. Presentations are intended for a non-technical audience, and should be 5-10 minutes long. Check [presentations 101](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PBPi3-VKWldvkrEyHNPJJHLKZuL1AApkgGG6DwXE6Zs/edit#slide=id.g522373b1e4_0_0) if you need guidelines or inspiration.  

### Github Must-Haves

Your github repository should contain all of the above, or links to the above if you're hosting them elsewhere (for example, if your presentation is made on Google Slides). Use a `.gitignore` and subfolders to keep everything organized if need be!

### Et Cetera

You must meet with a coach or instructor on Monday, so they can check the feasibility of your idea, and at least one other time before Friday's presentations. You're welcome to meet more than that, however!
